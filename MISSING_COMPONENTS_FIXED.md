npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 **What Should Work Now:**

### **Homepage Display:**
- ✅ Beautiful blue gradient hero section
- ✅ "Connecting the UK Building Merchant Ecosystem" title
- ✅ Organization selection cards (Toolbank, NMBS, BMN, BMF)
- ✅ Get Started and Learn More buttons
- ✅ Responsive mobile design

### **Navigation:**
- ✅ Header with BuildConnect logo
- ✅ Navigation menu (Features, Organizations, Pricing, About, Contact)
- ✅ Login and Sign Up buttons
- ✅ Dark mode toggle

### **Organization Cards:**
- ✅ **Toolbank** - Blue theme, "Keeping the Tool Trade Local"
- ✅ **NMBS** - Green theme, "1,250+ merchant members" 
- ✅ **BMN** - Purple theme, "Builders' Merchants News"
- ✅ **BMF** - Orange theme, "Trade association"

## 🔧 **What Was Causing the Errors:**

The terminal errors you saw were because several Polymet components were trying to import UI components that didn't exist:

```
❌ /src/components/ui/table - FIXED ✅
❌ /src/components/ui/dialog - FIXED ✅  
❌ /src/components/ui/accordion - FIXED ✅
❌ /src/components/ui/alert - FIXED ✅
```

These components are used by the documentation pages, but they were blocking the entire app from loading.

## 📱 **Expected Result:**

After running the fix, you should see:
1. **No more terminal errors**
2. **Homepage loads immediately at http://localhost:5173**
3. **Beautiful BuildConnect interface matching your design**
4. **All organization cards working and interactive**
5. **Smooth animations and responsive design**

## 🚨 **If You Still Have Issues:**

### **Check 1: Clear Cache**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Check 2: Port Issues** 
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### **Check 3: Browser**
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- Check browser console for any remaining errors
- Try incognito/private mode

## ✨ **What's Next:**

Once your homepage is working:
1. **🎨 Verify Design**: Ensure it matches your BuildConnect design
2. **🔧 Environment Setup**: Add Supabase credentials to `.env.local`
3. **🚀 Development**: Use Claude Code in Windsurf following the rules
4. **📋 Features**: Start building supplier portal, merchant dashboard, etc.

**Your BuildConnect homepage should now load perfectly! 🎉**

The beautiful blue gradient hero section with organization cards should display exactly as shown in your design image.
